# Round 42 - Remade

It was 1990 give or take and the first PC made it into my family's home. It came with three games. I remember them to this day:
1. Digger
1. A pinball game
1. Round 42

These were MS-DOS times (MS-DOS 3.21 to be exact) and getting them to start was, well, a bit more involved then it was these days.

But oh man was I hooked on Round 42 so I sat down and figured out how to get it running so I could play.

I felt it deserved a remake.
